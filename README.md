## **Project Title:**  
**AI-Assisted Plant Disease Detection and Management System**  

## **Project Description:**  
The **AI-Assisted Plant Disease Detection and Management System** is a deep learning-based solution designed to assist farmers and agricultural experts in identifying and managing plant diseases efficiently. This project utilizes **YOLOv5**, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to recognize diseases in **cotton plants** by analyzing images of plant leaves. The system not only detects and classifies plant diseases but also provides **crop recommendations and pesticide suggestions** to improve sustainable agricultural practices.  

A **user-friendly web application**, built using **Streamlit**, allows users to upload plant leaf images and receive instant disease detection results along with recommended treatments. The entire pipeline, from model training to deployment, has been implemented on **Google Colab and Streamlit**, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.  

### **Key Features:**  
- **Automated Disease Detection:** Uses YOLOv5 to identify plant diseases from images.  
- **Crop and Pesticide Recommendations:** Provides actionable insights based on disease detection.  
- **Web-Based Deployment:** A simple interface using Streamlit for real-time disease detection.  
- **Scalable & Reproducible:** Can be expanded for other plant species with additional training data.

# AI-Assisted Plant Disease Detection and Management System

## Overview  
This project focuses on identifying and classifying plant diseases in **cotton plants** using **YOLOv5**, a popular deep-learning model for object detection. The system suggests appropriate pesticides and crop recommendations to aid sustainable agriculture. A **Streamlit-based web application** allows users to upload plant leaf images and receive real-time predictions.

## Features  
- **Disease Detection:** Detects and classifies plant diseases using YOLOv5.  
- **Pesticide and Crop Recommendations:** Provides treatment suggestions for detected diseases.  
- **Web Interface:** Built using Streamlit for easy access and usability.  
- **Deployable on Cloud:** Compatible with Google Colab and AWS/GCP for scalable deployment.

## Installation & Setup  
### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Plant-Disease-Detection.git
cd AI-Plant-Disease-Detection
```

### **2. Model Training (Google Colab)**  
Run the **model_training_code.ipynb** notebook to train the YOLOv5 model on the dataset.  
```python
!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
%cd yolov5
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Modify **plant_disease_dataset.yaml** with dataset paths and run:  
```bash
!python train.py --data plant_disease_dataset.yaml --cfg models/yolov5s.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --batch 16
```

### **3. Deploying the Streamlit App**  
Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the application:  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The application will be accessible at **http://localhost:8501**  

## **Usage**  
1. Open the web app and upload a plant leaf image.  
2. The model will process the image and display the detected disease with confidence scores.  
3. Suggested treatments and crop recommendations will be displayed for further action.  

## **Dependencies**  
- Python 3.8+  
- PyTorch  
- YOLOv5  
- OpenCV  
- Streamlit
